title: Welcome to Dev Notes
text: I've been doing a lot of dev work both in and out of work. Needed to create a space to post notes of the different dev things I'm learning. Currently been working mostly with AI/ML technologies. Also been doing more Python development as part of that but recently been working on a TypeScript backend project. Expect notes covering a lot of topics and domains.
