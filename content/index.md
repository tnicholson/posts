title: Welcome to Dev Notes!
---

I've been doing a lot of development work both professionally and personally, and I needed a space to share the various things I'm learning. Currently, my focus has been primarily on AI/ML technologies, with a significant amount of Python development. Recently, I've also started working on a TypeScript backend project.

Expect notes covering a wide range of topics and domains. Stay tuned!
